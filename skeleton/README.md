With this simple app I've learned about creating a RESTful API using spring-boot and some other stuff like:

- Controllers
    - Generic Response
    - Exception Handler
- Services
- Model
    - Entities
    - DTOs
- Repositories
- Named Queries
- Using and Configuring JPA

## Thanks
Thank You Guilherme Chiavegatto for teach me how to make a Spring Boot Application from scratch.
